 Perfect! I can see all the required dependencies are already listed in your pyproject.toml:

  - google-api-python-client>=2.179.0
  - isodate>=0.7.2
  - python-dotenv>=1.1.1
  - requests>=2.32.4
  - youtube-transcript-api>=1.2.2

  The issue is that these packages aren't installed in the WSL Python environment. Since you're using uv from
  Windows, the dependencies would be managed there.

  You could either:
  1. Run the script from Windows where uv has installed the dependencies
  2. Install the packages in WSL if you want me to test here

  What would you prefer?

> curious.  how does intalling in wsl affect the project directory

● Great question! Installing packages in WSL would create a separate Python environment from your Windows
  project. Here's what would happen:

  WSL Installation:
  - Creates packages in WSL's Python site-packages (like /usr/lib/python3.x/site-packages/)
  - Doesn't affect your Windows uv project environment
  - Doesn't modify your pyproject.toml
  - Just allows me to run/test the code from this WSL terminal

  Your Windows Project:
  - Remains unchanged - uv manages its own virtual environment
  - Your pyproject.toml dependencies stay the same
  - When you run uv run python berg_explorer.py from Windows, it uses the uv-managed packages

  The Shared Directory:
  - The /mnt/c/Users/sean/Documents/DevProjects/RAGs/berg_nih/ directory is just mounted from Windows
  - Code changes I make are instantly visible in both environments
  - Only the Python package installations would be separate

  So installing in WSL would be purely for testing purposes and wouldn't interfere with your project setup.
  It's like having two different Python environments pointing to the same codebase.


 ## MVP Feature Planning

  Core MVP Components Needed:

  1. Symptom Input Interface
  - Simple text input: "I have fatigue and muscle cramps"
  - Symptom parsing/categorization
  - Map symptoms to potential deficiencies

  2. Cross-Reference Engine
  - Match user symptoms to Berg video topics
  - Find corresponding PMC research articles
  - Rank relevance and confidence

  3. Recommendation Generator
  - Berg's natural approach suggestions
  - Scientific backing from PMC articles
  - Dosage/implementation guidance
  - Confidence levels for recommendations

  4. Response Formatter
  - Natural language explanations
  - "Dr. Berg suggests X because Y"
  - "Research shows Z supports this approach"
  - Clear disclaimers about medical advice

  Technical Architecture:

  Data Layer: ✅ Complete
  - Berg dataset: 49 videos, 115 claims
  - PMC dataset: 15 articles, 192K words
  - Organized by vitamin/mineral topics

  Processing Layer: (Next to build)
  - Symptom → Deficiency mapper
  - Semantic search across datasets
  - Confidence scoring algorithm
  - Natural language generation

  API Layer: (Future)
  - REST endpoints for queries
  - Response formatting
  - Rate limiting, caching

  MVP User Flow:

  1. User: "I'm tired all the time and get leg cramps"
  2. System: Maps to B1/Magnesium deficiency
  3. System: Finds Berg videos + PMC research
  4. Response: "Dr. Berg suggests thiamine supplements for fatigue. Research confirms B1
  deficiency causes these symptoms. Here's what to try..."

  Project Notes for Wrap-up:

  Completed (This Session):

  - ✅ Refactored berg_explorer.py (eliminated redundant disk I/O)
  - ✅ Built comprehensive PMC fetching system
  - ✅ Curated 15 high-quality research articles
  - ✅ Organized project structure for MVP development
  - ✅ Created robust datasets linking Berg + research content

  Ready for Next Session:

  - Primary Datasets: Berg videos (320KB) + PMC articles (2.5MB)
  - Project Structure: Clean MVP layout with src/scripts/data separation
  - Development Environment: Python 3.13, uv package manager, all dependencies installed

  Immediate Next Steps:

  1. Build symptom parser in src/berg_nih/core/
  2. Create cross-reference engine using both datasets
  3. Develop recommendation system with confidence scoring
  4. Add simple CLI interface for testing

  Key Technical Decisions Made:

  - Two-step PMC approach (titles → full text) saved massive context
  - Berg video transcript analysis provides practical health claims
  - Open access PMC articles ensure commercial use compliance
  - Modular script organization enables easy maintenance

  Success Metrics for MVP:

  - User enters symptoms → Gets relevant Berg + research recommendations
  - Cross-references natural approaches with scientific evidence
  - Provides confidence levels and clear medical disclaimers
  - Processes common deficiency scenarios (B1, D, Magnesium, etc.)

  Project Status: Data foundation complete, ready for core MVP development. Excellent progress
  made with efficient context usage throughout the session.

  Ready for development sprint focused on the cross-reference engine and user interface!

> lets discuss the symptoms parser and cross-reference engine.

● Excellent! Let's dive into the core MVP components.

  Symptom Parser Design

  Input Processing Strategy:

  # User inputs like:
  "I'm tired all the time and get leg cramps at night"
  "Brain fog and can't sleep well"
  "Frequent urination and muscle weakness"

  Parsing Approach:

  Option 1: Rule-Based Matching
  symptom_patterns = {
      'fatigue': ['tired', 'exhausted', 'low energy', 'weakness'],
      'muscle_cramps': ['cramps', 'muscle pain', 'leg pain'],
      'brain_fog': ['foggy', 'confused', 'memory issues'],
      'sleep_issues': ['insomnia', 'can\'t sleep', 'poor sleep']
  }

  Option 2: Semantic Search (more advanced)
  - Use embeddings to match user text to known symptoms
  - More flexible but requires ML models

  Symptom → Deficiency Mapping:

  From your Berg dataset analysis:
  deficiency_patterns = {
      'thiamine_b1': ['fatigue', 'muscle_weakness', 'brain_fog', 'sleep_issues'],
      'magnesium': ['muscle_cramps', 'leg_cramps', 'anxiety', 'sleep_issues'],
      'vitamin_d': ['fatigue', 'bone_pain', 'immune_issues', 'depression'],
      'b12': ['numbness', 'tingling', 'memory_issues', 'fatigue'],
      'iron': ['fatigue', 'weakness', 'pale_skin', 'cold_hands']
  }

  Cross-Reference Engine Design

  Data Matching Strategy:

  1. Symptom → Berg Videos
    - Match parsed symptoms to video titles/transcripts
    - Extract relevant claims and recommendations
  2. Symptom → PMC Articles
    - Match to article abstracts and keywords
    - Find scientific backing for deficiencies
  3. Confidence Scoring
    - Strong match: Symptom appears in both Berg + PMC data
    - Medium: Appears in one dataset with supporting evidence
    - Weak: Indirect connection only

  Implementation Questions:

  Symptom Parser:
  - Start with rule-based patterns or go straight to semantic search?
  - How granular should symptom categories be?
  - Handle symptom combinations (fatigue + cramps = likely magnesium)?

  Cross-Reference Engine:
  - Weight Berg practical advice vs PMC research evidence?
  - How to handle conflicting information between sources?
  - Real-time search vs pre-computed symptom→recommendation mappings?

  Data Structure:
  - Should we pre-process the datasets into a symptom index?
  - Create intermediate "knowledge graph" of symptoms→deficiencies→treatments?
